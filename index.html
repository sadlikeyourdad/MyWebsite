    <h1>This is a web page.</h1>
    <p>There's not much here.</p>
    <p>Just words.</p>
    <p><strong>And you're reading them.</strong></p>
    <p>
      We've become obsessed with fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts
      that do magical things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>But the most powerful tool on the web is still words.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote these words, and you're reading them: <em>that's</em> magical.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm in a little city in British Columbia; you're probably somewhere else.
      I wrote this early in the morning, June 20th, 2013; you're reading it at a
      different time. I wrote this on my laptop; you could be reading this on
      your phone, a tablet or a desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      You and I have been able to connect because<em> I wrote this </em>and
      <em>you're reading it.</em> <strong>That's the web</strong>. Despite our
      different locations, devices, and time-zones we can connect
      <em>here, </em>on a simple HTML page.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote this in a text editor. It's 6&nbsp;kB. I didn't need a Content
      Management System, a graphic designer, or a software developer. There's
      not much code on this page at all: just simple markup for paragraphs,
      hierarchy, and emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember teaching my daughter to code HTML when she was 8. The first
      thing she wrote was
      <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/squirrel">a story about a squirrel</a>. She
      wasn't &quot;writing HTML&quot;;
      <strong>she was sharing something with the world</strong>. She couldn't
      believe that she could write a story on our home computer, and then
      publish it for the world to see. She didn't care about HTML; she cared
      about sharing her stories.
    </p>
    <p><strong>You are still reading.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Think about all the things you could communicate with a simple page like
      this. If you're a businessperson, you could sell something. If you're a
      teacher, you could teach something. If you're an artist, you could show
      something you've made.
      <strong>And if your words are good, people will read them.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're a web designer, I challenge you to think about the words first.
      Instead of starting with a style guide or a Photoshop mockup,
      <em>start with words on a page</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you have to say? If you don't know, there's not much use in adding
      all that other cruft. <strong>Just start with one page</strong>, with a
      single focus. Write it and publish it, and then <em>iterate on that</em>.
      Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me
      communicate better? Will that additional styling, image, or hyperlink give
      my audience more understanding? If the answer is &quot;no,&quot; don't add
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>At its heart, web design should be about words</strong>. Words
      don't come <em>after</em> the design is done. Words are the beginning, the
      core, the focus.
    </p>
    <p>Start with words.</p>
    <p>
      Cheers,<br />
