    <h1>This is a web page.</h1>
    <p>There's not much here.</p>
    <p>Just words.</p>
    <p><strong>And you're reading them.</strong></p>
    <p>
      We've become obsessed with fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts
      that do magical things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>But the most powerful tool on the web is still words.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote these words, and you're reading them: <em>that's</em> magical.

      I'm in a little city in British Columbia; you're probably somewhere else.
      I wrote this early in the morning, June 20th, 2013; you're reading it at a
      different time. I wrote this on my laptop; you could be reading this on
      your phone, a tablet or a desktop.

      You and I have been able to connect because<em> I wrote this </em>and
      <em>you're reading it.</em> <strong>That's the web</strong>. Despite our
      different locations, devices, and time-zones we can connect
      <em>here, </em>on a simple HTML page.

      Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is [Name], and I am a skilled reverse engineer and malware analyst. I have a passion for understanding how things work, and I enjoy using my knowledge and skills to solve complex problems.

I have been working in the field of reverse engineering and malware analysis for [number] years, and I have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in these areas. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, including assembly language, and I have a strong understanding of computer systems and how they operate.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest developments in the field and learning about new technologies and techniques. I am also an avid [hobby] enthusiast, and I enjoy spending time outdoors and staying active.

Thank you for visiting my website, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you would like to know more about my skills and experience.

About My Reverse Engineering Skills:

As a skilled reverse engineer, I have a strong understanding of how systems and software work, and I am able to identify and analyze their inner workings. I am proficient in a variety of tools and techniques that are commonly used in reverse engineering, and I have experience working with both low-level and high-level programming languages.

One of my specialties is assembly language, which is a low-level programming language that is used to write programs that run directly on a computer's processor. I have a deep understanding of how assembly language works, and I am able to use it to analyze and understand the behavior of software and systems at a very low level.

In addition to my skills in reverse engineering, I am also experienced in malware analysis. I have worked on a number of projects where I have been responsible for identifying and analyzing malicious software, and I have developed a strong understanding of the techniques and tactics that are commonly used by attackers.

Overall, my skills in reverse engineering and malware analysis have allowed me to make valuable contributions to a variety of projects, and I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my knowledge and experience in these areas.

      I remember teaching my daughter to code HTML when she was 8. The first
      thing she wrote was
      <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/squirrel">a story about a squirrel</a>. She
      wasn't &quot;writing HTML&quot;;
      <strong>she was sharing something with the world</strong>. She couldn't
      believe that she could write a story on our home computer, and then
      publish it for the world to see. She didn't care about HTML; she cared
      about sharing her stories.

    <p><strong>You are still reading.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Think about all the things you could communicate with a simple page like
      this. If you're a businessperson, you could sell something. If you're a
      teacher, you could teach something. If you're an artist, you could show
      something you've made.
      <strong>And if your words are good, people will read them.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're a web designer, I challenge you to think about the words first.
      Instead of starting with a style guide or a Photoshop mockup,
      <em>start with words on a page</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you have to say? If you don't know, there's not much use in adding
      all that other cruft. <strong>Just start with one page</strong>, with a
      single focus. Write it and publish it, and then <em>iterate on that</em>.
      Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me
      communicate better? Will that additional styling, image, or hyperlink give
      my audience more understanding? If the answer is &quot;no,&quot; don't add
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>At its heart, web design should be about words</strong>. Words
      don't come <em>after</em> the design is done. Words are the beginning, the
      core, the focus.
    </p>
    <p>Start with words.</p>
    <p>
